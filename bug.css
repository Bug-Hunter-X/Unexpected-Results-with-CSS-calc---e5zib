The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, it can lead to unexpected results if used incorrectly, such as using it with units inconsistently or forgetting operator precedence. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` is correct but `width: calc(100% - 10);` is incorrect as '10' is missing 'px' or other unit.
